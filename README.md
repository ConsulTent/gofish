## PLEASE SEE [fishworks/gofish](https://github.com/fishworks/gofish) FOR OFFICIAL CODE ARCHIVE.

## What does GoFish do?

GoFish is a cross-platform systems package manager, bringing the ease of use of Homebrew to
Linux and Windows.

```
$ gofish install go
==> Installing go...
üê†  go 1.10.1: installed in 2.307602197s
```

GoFish works across all three major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux). It installs
packages into its own directory and symlinks their files into /usr/local (or C:\ProgramData for Windows).
You can think of it as the cross-platform Homebrew.
